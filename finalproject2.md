Notes
After Countless days and hours of attempting to connect mariadb with the apache server I have given up sadly. I got as far as one point I was able to enter this Url "http://34.136.71.173/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php" and I could see that my linuxdb database and wordpress were installed on my virtual machine but they were not connecting to eachother unforntuantely. I had a similar problem while trying to complete project 1 but to fix that I was able to go into my root user and edit the config files but for some reason I cant even get to that point here.
